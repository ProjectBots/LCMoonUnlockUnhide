## MoonUnlockUnhide

This is a simple tweak that unhides and/or unlocks moons like Sector-0 from [Rosies_Moons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RosiePies/Rosies_Moons/) by [RosiePies](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RosiePies/).

It also makes StarlancerZero ([StarlancerMoons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AudioKnight/StarlancerMoons/)) routable as `starlancerzero` instead of `[REDACTED]`.
